# Foundation Docs

[Foundation Docs](https://docs.huly.io/) contains documentation for the Foundation platform. While Foundation Docs is currently in the early stages of development, our goal is for all concepts and features to be fully documented for our users.

Foundation is a fork of the [hcengineering/platform](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform) project, building upon its robust foundation to create an enhanced collaboration and project management solution.

## Submitting requests and feedback

If there is a specific concept or feature you'd like to see covered in Foundation Docs, the best way to let us know is to join our [Foundation Community](https://huly.link/slack) on Slack to connect with other Foundation users and communicate directly with our team.

Requests and feedback may also be submitted by email to [hey@huly.io](hey@huly.io).

Your valuable input will guide which features we prioritize and help us create more thorough documentation for users!
